# Camping Tour Poster - Implementation Details

## Project Overview

This project creates an interactive and visually appealing poster for a camping tour using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design follows a modern approach with responsive layouts, animations, and interactive elements.

## Files Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML structure of the poster
- `style.css` - Styling for the poster including layout, colors, and responsive design
- `script.js` - JavaScript for animations and interactive elements
- `preload.js` - Optimizes image loading and adds a loading indicator
- `README.md` - Basic usage instructions
- `overview.md` - This file, containing technical details

## Implementation Details

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is organized in a semantic way with:
- Header section with logo, title, and price
- Main content section with two columns: 
  - Left column for the itinerary timeline
  - Right column for services and menu
- Footer with contact information

### CSS Features

- CSS Variables for consistent color scheme
- Flexbox layout for responsive design
- Media queries for mobile responsiveness
- Custom animations and transitions
- Border radius and shadows for modern design
- Timeline design with circles and connecting lines

### JavaScript Functionality

- Loading progress indicator for images
- Animations for timeline items appearing sequentially
- Hover effects for interactive elements
- Parallax scrolling effect for the header background
- Countdown timer for promotion

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of images
- Preloading of critical images
- CSS transitions instead of JavaScript for smooth animations
- Intersection Observer API for only loading visible content

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)

## Customization Options

The poster can be easily customized by:
1. Changing color variables in CSS
2. Updating images by replacing URLs
3. Modifying content in the HTML structure
4. Adjusting animations in JavaScript

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to view the poster.
